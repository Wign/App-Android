## App
This is the git repository for developing a android app for Wign.

## Wign: a collaboration-based danish sign language encyclopedia
The idea of Wign is inspired from a post by Kenneth Andersen in a blog of [Danish Deaf Youth Association](http://www.ddu.dk) (DDU).
Wign is a is about a sign language encyclopedia (not to be confused with dictionary!), which everyone can contribute and share with signs for rarely used terms. A social danish sign language platform very alike Wikipedia.

The main web app can be found at [Wign/Wign](https://github.com/Wign/Wign).

## Why github?
The project was run by [DDU](http://ddu.dk/) and [12K](http://www.12k.dk), but failed due to complicated setup and communication issues with the website provider.
Now we decided to release the code behind the project open source and collaboration-based, as Wign self. The project is run by Wign IVS, to contribute to a richer sign language sharing among us danish deaf.

**You** are therefore invited to take part in the code and fix out issues and other fuzzies in the codes! [To help with the code](https://github.com/Wign/App-Android/wiki/To-contribute-to-the-project)
